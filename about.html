                        <p>Yoga is an opportunity to know yourself better. Only you can become the world’s leading
                            expert on your life—but first
                            you must learn how to observe yourself and how you work. In yoga, you are the laboratory.
                            Yoga Lab is a supportive
                            environment where people can gather and share in the spirit of learning, self-discovery, and
                            continued growth. See below

                        <p>Five founding teachers came together to create Yoga Lab based on our common interest in
                            anatomy
                            and functional movement,
                            and in combining Western science with Eastern wisdom. We are committed to teaching a
                            sustainable
                            yoga practice that
                            integrates and enriches the body, mind, and soul. We teach a vinyasa-flow based style of
                            yoga
                            that connects you to your
                            core through intelligent sequencing and functional movement. We have diverse scholarly
                            backgrounds, including advanced
                            degrees in psychology, philosophy, and biology. We have all trained in multiple styles
                            of yoga,
                            including advanced
                            training with a physical therapist, Lara Heimann, so we share a strong foundation in
                            anatomy and
                            functional movement. We
                            integrate this knowledge to provide you with the best possible class experience. We are
                            pleased
                            to be joined by several
                            other amazing teachers who share our values.</p>

                                        The science of Yoga is nothing but positive psychology, it includes the theory
                                        and practices of developing a positive
                                        state of mind, positive thinking, positive emotions and positive behaviour. The
                                        problems of human life are in the
                                        conditionings of the mind. Yoga focuses on changing these old conditionings so
                                        the negative state is changed to a
                                        peaceful and content state of mind. This change can be experienced by everyone
                                        with regular practice.</p>
